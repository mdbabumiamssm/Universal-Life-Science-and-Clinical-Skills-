`txg` is the command-line interface to the 10x Genomics Cloud.

# Linux/MacOS Installation

`txg` is a single binary, so it doesn't need to be explicitly installed to use
it.  You can run it from the current directory with `./txg`, or use an absolute
path to run it from somewhere else with `/path/to/txg`, or add it to your `PATH`
to use it from anywhere with `txg`.

# Windows Installation

`txg.exe` is a single binary, so it doesn't need to be explicitly installed to

absolute path to run it from somewhere else with `C:\path\to\txg.exe`.
