    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a sophisticated multi-agent system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. The system consists of specialized agents that work together to perform complex research tasks, including data collection, analysis, and report generation. This approach showcases how AI agents can collaborate to solve problems that would be challenging for a single agent to handle alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple AI agents with different roles working together\n",
    "- **Automated Group Chat**: Agents communicate through structured conversations\n",
    "- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a specific function (planning, coding, analysis, etc.)\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Agents can execute code, scrape web data, and generate reports"
