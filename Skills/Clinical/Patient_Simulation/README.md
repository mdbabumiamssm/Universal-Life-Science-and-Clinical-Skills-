The **Patient Simulation Agent** creates high-fidelity virtual patients for medical education, exam preparation (OSCEs), and benchmarking other clinical AI agents.

## Key Capabilities

- **Persona Generation:** detailed medical histories, symptoms, and personality traits.
- **Conversational Interface:** simulating a patient interview (history taking).
- **Dynamic State:** The patient's condition can evolve based on the "doctor's" (user's) actions or questions.
- **Feedback Mode:** After the interaction, the agent switches roles to provide feedback to the student regarding their diagnostic approach.

## Use Cases
- **Medical Student Training:** Practicing difficult conversations or rare diagnoses.
- **Agent Evaluation:** Testing the "Doctor Agent" (e.g., Clinical Decision Support) against a battery of simulated cases (MedAgentBench).
