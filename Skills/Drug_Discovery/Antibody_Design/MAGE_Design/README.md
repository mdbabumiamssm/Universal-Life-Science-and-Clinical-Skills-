## Overview

**MAGE** is a protein language model specifically designed for the de novo design of monoclonal antibodies. Developed with ARPA-H funding, it aims to generate antibodies against unseen viral strains or difficult targets by learning the evolutionary landscape of antibody-antigen interactions.

## Key Capabilities

- **De Novo Design:** Generates heavy/light chain sequences from scratch.
- **Epitope Targeting:** Optimized for specific binding sites.
- **Viral Neutralization:** Focused on thwarting novel viruses.

## Related Tools
- **RFdiffusion for Antibodies:** Structure-based design.
- **ProteinMPNN:** Sequence recovery from backbone.
